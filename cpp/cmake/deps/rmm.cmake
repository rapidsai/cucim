# Note: importing rmm is tricky as it depends on googletest/thrust/spdlog and can conflicts with target names in
#       the original project.
#       There is a suggestion in CMake but it seems that it takes time to resolve the issue.
#       - Namespace support for target names in nested projects: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/16414
