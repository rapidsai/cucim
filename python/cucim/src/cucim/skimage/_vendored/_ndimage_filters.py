    Args:
        input (cupy.ndarray): The input array.
        sigma (scalar or sequence of scalar): Standard deviations for each axis
            of Gaussian kernel. A single value applies to all axes.
        order (int or sequence of scalar): An order of ``0``, the default,
            corresponds to convolution with a Gaussian kernel. A positive order
            corresponds to convolution with that derivative of a Gaussian. A
            single value applies to all axes.
        output (cupy.ndarray, dtype or None): The array in which to place the
            output. Default is is same dtype as the input.
        mode (str or sequence of str): The array borders are handled according
            to the given mode (``'reflect'``, ``'constant'``, ``'nearest'``,
            ``'mirror'``, ``'wrap'``). Default is ``'reflect'``. By passing a
            sequence of modes with length equal to the number of ``axes`` along
            which the input array is being filtered, different modes can be
            specified along each axis. For more details on the supported modes,
            see :func:`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter`.
        cval (scalar): Value to fill past edges of input if mode is
            ``'constant'``. Default is ``0.0``.
        truncate (float): Truncate the filter at this many standard deviations.
            Default is ``4.0``.
        radius (int, sequence of int, or None): Radius of the Gaussian kernel.
            The radius are given for each axis as a sequence, or as a single
            number, in which case it is equal for all axes. If specified, the
            size of the kernel along each axis will be ``2*radius + 1``, and
            `truncate` is ignored. Default is ``None``.
        axes (tuple of int or None): If None, ``input`` is filtered along all
            axes. Otherwise, ``input`` is filtered along the specified axes.
            When ``axes`` is specified, any tuples used for ``sigma``,
            ``order``, ``mode`` and/or ``radius`` must match the length of
            ``axes``. The ith entry in any of these tuples corresponds to the
            ith entry in ``axes``. Default is ``None``.

        input (cupy.ndarray): The input array.
        percentile (scalar): The percentile of the element to get (from ``0``
            to ``100``). Can be negative, thus ``-20`` equals ``80``.
        size (int or sequence of int): One of ``size`` or ``footprint`` must be
            provided. If ``footprint`` is given, ``size`` is ignored. Otherwise
            ``footprint = cupy.ones(size)`` with ``size`` automatically made to
            match the number of dimensions in ``input``.
        footprint (cupy.ndarray): a boolean array which specifies which of the
            elements within this shape will get passed to the filter function.
        output (cupy.ndarray, dtype or None): The array in which to place the
            output. Default is is same dtype as the input.
        mode (str): The array borders are handled according to the given mode
            (``'reflect'``, ``'constant'``, ``'nearest'``, ``'mirror'``,
            ``'wrap'``). Default is ``'reflect'``.
        cval (scalar): Value to fill past edges of input if mode is
            ``'constant'``. Default is ``0.0``.
        origin (int or sequence of int): The origin parameter controls the
            placement of the filter, relative to the center of the current
            element of the input. Default of 0 is equivalent to
            ``(0,)*input.ndim``.
        axes (tuple of int or None): If None, ``input`` is filtered along all
            axes. Otherwise, ``input`` is filtered along the specified axes.
            When ``axes`` is specified, any tuples used for ``size`` and/or
            ``origin`` must match the length of ``axes``. The ith entry in any
            of these tuples corresponds to the ith entry in ``axes``. Default
            is ``None``.

    Returns:
        cupy.ndarray: The result of the filtering.
