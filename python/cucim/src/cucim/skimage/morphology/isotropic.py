    """Return binary morphological erosion of an image.

    This function returns the same result as
    :func:`skimage.morphology.binary_erosion` but performs faster for large
    circular structuring elements. This works by applying a threshold to the
    exact Euclidean distance map of the image [1]_, [2]_. The implementation is
    based on:
    func:`cucim.core.operations.morphology.distance_transform_edt`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Binary input image.
    radius : float
        The radius by which regions should be eroded.
    out : ndarray of bool, optional
        The array to store the result of the morphology. If None,
        a new array will be allocated.
    spacing : float, or sequence of float, optional
        Spacing of elements along each dimension.
        If a sequence, must be of length equal to the input's dimension
        (number of axes). If a single number, this value is used for all axes.
        If not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.

    Returns
    -------
    eroded : ndarray of bool
        The result of the morphological erosion taking values in
        ``[False, True]``.

    Notes
    -----
    Empirically, on an RTX A6000 GPU, it was observed that
    ``isotropic_erosion`` is faster than ``binary_erosion`` with
    ``decomposition=None`` at radius 12 in 2D and radius 3 in 3D. It becomes
    faster than ``binary_erosion`` with ``decomposition="sequence"`` at radius
    14 in 2D and radius 5 in 3D. In practice, the exact point at which these
    isotropic functions become faster than their binary counterparts will also
    be dependent on image shape and content.
