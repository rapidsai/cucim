"""GPU Image Processing for Python

This module is a CuPy based implementation of a subset of scikit-image.

It is a collection of algorithms for image processing and computer vision.

The main package only provides a few utilities for converting between image
data types; for most features, you need to import one of the following
subpackages:

Subpackages
-----------
color
    Color space conversion.
data
    Test images and example data.
exposure
    Image intensity adjustment, e.g., histogram equalization, etc.
feature
    Feature detection and extraction, e.g., texture analysis, corners, etc.
filters
    Sharpening, edge finding, rank filters, thresholding, etc.
measure
    Measurement of image properties, e.g., region properties, moments.
metrics
    Metrics corresponding to images, e.g., distance metrics, similarity, etc.
morphology
    Morphological algorithms, e.g., closing, opening, skeletonization.
registration
    Image registration algorithms, e.g., optical flow or phase cross
    correlation.
restoration
    Restoration algorithms, e.g., deconvolution algorithms, denoising, etc.
segmentation
    Algorithms to partition images into meaningful regions or boundaries.
transform
    Geometric and other transformations, e.g., rotations, warp.
util
    Generic utilities.

Utility Functions
-----------------
img_as_float
    Convert an image to floating point format, with values in [0, 1].
    Is similar to `img_as_float64`, but will not convert lower-precision
    floating point arrays to `float64`.
img_as_float32
    Convert an image to single-precision (32-bit) floating point format,
    with values in [0, 1].
img_as_float64
    Convert an image to double-precision (64-bit) floating point format,
    with values in [0, 1].
img_as_uint
    Convert an image to unsigned integer format, with values in [0, 65535].
img_as_int
    Convert an image to signed integer format, with values in [-32768, 32767].
img_as_ubyte
    Convert an image to unsigned byte format, with values in [0, 255].
img_as_bool
    Convert an image to boolean format, with values either True or False.
dtype_limits
    Return intensity limits, i.e. (min, max) tuple, of the image's dtype.
