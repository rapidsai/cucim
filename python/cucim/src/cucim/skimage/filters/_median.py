    """Return local median of an image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array-like
        Input image.
    footprint : ndarray, tuple of int, or None
        If ``None``, ``footprint`` will be a N-D array with 3 elements for each
        dimension (e.g., vector, square, cube, etc.). If `footprint` is a
        tuple of integers, it will be an array of ones with the given shape.
        Otherwise, if ``behavior=='rank'``, ``footprint`` is a 2-D array of 1's
        and 0's. If ``behavior=='ndimage'``, ``footprint`` is a N-D array of
        1's and 0's with the same number of dimension as ``image``.
        Note that upstream scikit-image currently does not support supplying
        a tuple for `footprint`. It is added here to avoid overhead of
        generating a small weights array in cases where it is not needed.
    out : ndarray, (same dtype as image), optional
        If None, a new array is allocated.
    mode : {'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror','â€˜wrap'}, optional
        The mode parameter determines how the array borders are handled, where
        ``cval`` is the value when mode is equal to 'constant'.
        Default is 'nearest'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.15
           ``mode`` is used when ``behavior='ndimage'``.
    cval : scalar, optional
        Value to fill past edges of input if mode is 'constant'. Default is 0.0

        .. versionadded:: 0.15
           ``cval`` was added in 0.15 is used when ``behavior='ndimage'``.
    behavior : {'ndimage', 'rank'}, optional
        Either to use the old behavior (i.e., < 0.15) or the new behavior.
        The old behavior will call the :func:`skimage.filters.rank.median`.
        The new behavior will call the :func:`scipy.ndimage.median_filter`.
        Default is 'ndimage'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.15
           ``behavior`` is introduced in 0.15
        .. versionchanged:: 0.16
           Default ``behavior`` has been changed from 'rank' to 'ndimage'

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    algorithm : {'auto', 'histogram', 'sorting'}
        Determines which algorithm is used to compute the median. The default
        of 'auto' will attempt to use a histogram-based algorithm for 2D
        images with 8 or 16-bit integer data types. Otherwise a sorting-based
        algorithm will be used. Note: this paramter is cuCIM-specific and does
        not exist in upstream scikit-image.
    algorithm_kwargs : dict
        Any additional algorithm-specific keywords. Currently can only be used
        to set the number of parallel partitions for the 'histogram' algorithm.
        (e.g. ``algorithm_kwargs={'partitions': 256}``). Note: this paramter is
        cuCIM-specific and does not exist in upstream scikit-image.

    Returns
    -------
    out : 2-D array (same dtype as input image)
        Output image.

    See also
    --------
    skimage.filters.rank.median : Rank-based implementation of the median
        filtering offering more flexibility with additional parameters but
        dedicated for unsigned integer images.

    Notes
    -----
    An efficient, histogram-based median filter as described in [1]_ is faster
    than the sorting based approach for larger kernel sizes (e.g. greater than
    13x13 or so in 2D). It has near-constant run time regardless of the kernel
    size. The algorithm presented in [1]_ has been adapted to additional bit
    depths here. When algorithm='auto', the histogram-based algorithm will be
    chosen for integer-valued images with sufficiently large footprint size.
    Otherwise, the sorting-based approach is used.
