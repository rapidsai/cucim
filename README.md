[RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) cuCIM is an open-source, accelerated computer vision and image processing software library for multidimensional images used in biomedical, geospatial, material and life science, and remote sensing use cases.

cuCIM offers:

- Enhanced Image Processing Capabilities for large and n-dimensional tag image file format (TIFF) files
- Accelerated performance through Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based image processing and computer vision primitives
- A Straightforward Pythonic Interface with Matching Application Programming Interface (API) for Openslide

cuCIM supports the following formats:

- Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide (SVS)
- Philips TIFF
- Generic Tiled, Multi-resolution RGB TIFF files with the following compression schemes:
  - No Compression
  - JPEG
  - JPEG2000
  - Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
  - Deflate

**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim/blob/main/README.md) ensure you are on the `main` branch.

```bash
conda create -n cucim -c rapidsai -c conda-forge cucim cuda-version=`<CUDA version>`
```

`<CUDA version>` should be 11.2+ (e.g., `11.2`, `12.0`, etc.)

#### [Conda (nightlies)](https://anaconda.org/rapidsai-nightly/cucim)

```bash
conda create -n cucim -c rapidsai-nightly -c conda-forge cucim cuda-version=`<CUDA version>`
```

`<CUDA version>` should be 11.2+ (e.g., `11.2`, `12.0`, etc.)

### [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cucim/)

Install for CUDA 12:

```bash
pip install cucim-cu12
```

Alternatively install for CUDA 11:

```bash
pip install cucim-cu11
```

### Notebooks

Please check out our [Welcome](notebooks/Welcome.ipynb) notebook ([NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rapidsai/cucim/blob/branch-24.02/notebooks/Welcome.ipynb))

#### Downloading sample images

To download images used in the notebooks, please execute the following commands from the repository root folder to copy sample input images into `notebooks/input` folder:

(You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed in your system)

```bash
./run download_testdata
```
or

```bash
mkdir -p notebooks/input
tmp_id=$(docker create gigony/svs-testdata:little-big)
docker cp $tmp_id:/input notebooks
docker rm -v ${tmp_id}
```
