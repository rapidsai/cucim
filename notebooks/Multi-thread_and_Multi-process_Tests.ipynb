    "# Multi-thread and Multi-process Tests\n",

    "In this notebook, we compare cuCIM with OpenSlide in a multi-thread/multi-process environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`input/image2.tif` file (whose size is 92344x81017 and tile size is 256x256) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since cuCIM doesn't implement internal cache yet, according to `start_location` variable in the experiment code, cuCIM would have a different performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](static_images/Multi-thread_and_Multi-process_Tests_Alignment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first case (`start_location = 0`), when we try to read the whole image starting from (0,0) with 256x256 patch size, both OpenSlide and cuCIM would read each time only once.\n",
    "However, in the second case (`start_location = 1`) that starts reading patch from (1,1), cuCIM would have a disadvantage -- for the second patch (second red box), cuCIM should need four tiles whereas OpenSlide would use only two tiles (two tiles in the middle would be cached when OpenSlide read the first patch).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note::** cuCIM would support cache mechanism in the near future.\n",
